Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking spaces with their respective symbols, typically "X" and
"O", aiming to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their marks. The game ends when a player achieves this goal or when the grid is full, resulting in a draw. It's a simple yet engaging game suitable for all ages.
